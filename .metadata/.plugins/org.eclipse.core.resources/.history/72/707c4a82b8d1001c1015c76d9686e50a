          * stream by importing java.util.stream package.
          * Stream does not store elements. It simply conveys elements 
            from a source such as a data structure, an array, or an I/O channel, 
            through a pipeline of computational operations.
          * Operations performed on a stream does not modify it's source. For example, 
            filtering a Stream obtained from a collection produces a new Stream without the filtered elements, 
            rather than removing elements from the source collection.
          * You can use stream to filter, collect, print, and convert from one data structure to other etc
