            through a pipeline of computational operations.
          * Operations performed on a stream does not modify it's source. For example, 
            filtering a Stream obtained from a collection produces a new Stream without the filtered elements, 
            rather than removing elements from the source collection.

          * source->filter->sort->map->collect
