		 * An interface that does not contain methods, fields, and constants is known as marker interface.
		 * It delivers the run-time type information about an object. It is the reason that the JVM and compiler have additional information about an object.   
		 *Its uses, built-in (Serializable, Cloneable, and Remote Interfaces) and custom marker interface with examples
		 
		 The declaration of marker interface is the same as interface in Java but the interface must be empty. For example:
         public interface Serializable   
{  
  
}
